# My learning react journey

This is the project that I will use to learn react and get comfortable with it. Its going to be crazy fun of experimentation of what I learn and my personal coding style since react has a very unique SOC when it comes to their components so it will be fun to see how I can adhere to one of my favourite things when writing code which is writitng clean code whilst making React applications that actually work.
